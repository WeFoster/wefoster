<p><strong> Built for BuddyPress </strong></p>
<p>When our team sat down to create a new theme written from the ground up with BuddyPress in mind, we already had 5+ years of experience under our belts developing BuddyPress communities and products. We used all of this experience to make the most flexible and easy to use theme available.</p>

<ol>
<li>Completely Redesigned Member &amp; Group Pages</li>
<li>Beautiful crisp icons and many UI/UX improvements.</li>
<li>Unique Sidebars for Posts, Pages and all BuddyPress Components and BBPress forums.</li>
<li>Guaranteed support and styling for all popular BuddyPress plugins, both free and premium.</li>

Instead of modifying the WeFoster theme files directly, download our child theme and override within.</p>
