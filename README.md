** Built for BuddyPress **

When our team sat down to create a new theme written from the ground up with BuddyPress in mind, we already had 5+ years of experience under our belts developing BuddyPress communities and products. We used all of this experience to make the most flexible and easy to use theme available.

** A few highlights.. **
1. Completely Redesigned Member & Group Pages
2. Beautiful crisp icons and many UI/UX improvements.
3. Unique Sidebars for Posts, Pages and all BuddyPress Components and BBPress forums.
4. Guaranteed support and styling for all popular BuddyPress plugins, both free and premium.
5. Beautiful integration of the new BuddyPress Cover Images.
6. Full Multisite support.

## Child Theme ##

Child themes allow you to modify or add to the functionality of the WeFoster theme. A child theme is the best, safest, and easiest way to modify an existing theme, whether you want to make a few tiny changes or extensive changes. Instead of modifying the WeFoster theme files directly, download our child theme and override within.
